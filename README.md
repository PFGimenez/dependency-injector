# A simple dependency injector

## Downloading / compiling

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PFGimenez/dependency-injector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PFGimenez/dependency-injector)

You can find the latest compiled .jar here : https://github.com/PFGimenez/dependency-injector/releases/download/latest/injector.jar.

Otherwise, you can compile it yourself. You will need a JDK and ```ant```.

    $ git clone https://github.com/PFGimenez/dependency-injector.git --depth 1
    $ cd dependency-injector
    $ ant

The file ```injector.jar```, containing the compiled code .class and the sources .java, will be created.
