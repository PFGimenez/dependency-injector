# A simple dependency injector

## Downloading / compiling

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PFGimenez/dependency-injector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PFGimenez/dependency-injector)

You can find the latest compiled .jar here : https://github.com/PFGimenez/dependency-injector/releases/tag/latest.

Otherwise, you can compile it yourself. You will need a JDK and ```ant```.

    $ git clone https://github.com/PFGimenez/dependency-injector.git --depth 1
    $ cd dependency-injector
    $ ant

Two files will be created :
- injector.jar, containing the compiled code .class
- injector-sources.jar, containing the sources .java
